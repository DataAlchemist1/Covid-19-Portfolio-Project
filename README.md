# Covid -19 Death Project
## About This Project
This project involves the cleaning and exploration of a dataset tracking Covid-19 deaths worldwide. The goals of the project are to prepare the raw dataset for analysis by handling missing data, correcting data inconsistencies, and transforming data formats. With a refined, analysis-ready dataset, we can gain better insights into the impact and trends related to Covid-19 mortality around the globe. The final cleaned dataset may be used to build interactive visualizations, models, or applications to share findings from the data.
## Data Cleaning Steps
1. Import raw CSV dataset into SQL database
2. Examine dataset schema and summary statistics to discover any issues with data types, formats, ranges etc
3. Handle missing values by flagging, imputing reasonable defaults, or dropping rows if needed
4. Identify and remove or correct anomalies and outliers that may distort analysis
5. Standardize formats for location/date columns
6. Check integrity constraints and relationships between death counts and location/date attributes
7. Create cleaned, well-formatted dataset as final production table for further analysis and visualization
8. Document data cleaning process and decisions for transparency and reproducibility

The major tasks involved are assessing data quality, resolving inconsistencies, handling missing data, standardizing formats, and ensuring integrity for downstream usage. The final clean dataset will enable more accurate analytics.
